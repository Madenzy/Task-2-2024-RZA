1. Introduction and Objectives

This feedback plan outlines the structured approach that will be used to gather meaningful feedback on the GibJohn Tutoring prototype. The prototype is a multi-role tutoring platform designed to support students, tutors, parents, and administrators. Key features include user registration and authentication, student dashboards, assignment submission, tutor resource management, progress tracking, XP-based gamification, and role-based access control.

The purpose of gathering feedback is to ensure that the prototype meets the requirements outlined by GibJohn and is suitable for its intended users. Feedback will be used to evaluate both the usability and technical quality of the system and to identify areas for refinement.

The objectives of this feedback process are to:

Evaluate how effectively the prototype meets GibJohn’s functional and non-functional requirements

Identify usability and accessibility issues experienced by real users

Assess the technical implementation, including code structure, security, and performance

Collect evidence-informed data to support improvements and future development

Ensure the solution meets the needs of both technical and non-technical stakeholders

This plan demonstrates a systematic and professional methodology for gathering high-quality, actionable feedback over a defined timeframe.

2. Identification of Target Audiences

To ensure comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the prototype, feedback will be collected from a range of technical and non-technical audiences. Each audience has been selected based on their relevance to the GibJohn Tutoring platform.

Non-Technical Audiences
Audience Type	Number	Rationale
Students (11–14)	2	Primary end users; represent younger learners who will use quizzes, assignments, and dashboards
Students (15–18)	1	Can evaluate content suitability and usability for older learners
Parents	1	Will monitor student progress and safeguarding features
Tutors	1	Will upload resources, create assignments, and grade submissions
Technical Audiences
Audience Type	Number	Rationale
Programming Professional	1	Conducts code review to assess security, efficiency, and structure
IT/Computing Peer	1	Provides a secondary technical perspective on implementation choices

Total Participants: 7

This mix ensures feedback is collected from all key stakeholder groups identified in the GibJohn brief, with particular focus on students as the primary users, while also incorporating technical validation of the system.

3. Overview of Feedback Materials

To gather structured and targeted feedback, a range of materials will be created, each designed for a specific audience and purpose.

3.1 Screencasts / Demonstrations

Non-Technical Screencast (3–5 minutes)

Target Audience: Students, Parents, Tutors

Purpose: Demonstrate how the system is used from a user perspective

Coverage: Registration, dashboards, assignments, progress tracking, XP system, navigation

Technical Screencast (5–7 minutes)

Target Audience: Programming professional, IT peer

Purpose: Explain technical decisions and implementation

Coverage: Flask architecture, database models, authentication, validation, security measures, code organisation and comments

3.2 Questionnaires

Non-Technical Questionnaire

Target Audience: Students, Parents, Tutors

Focus Areas:

Ease of use

Interface clarity

Feature usefulness

Accessibility

Question Types: Likert scale ratings, multiple choice, open-ended questions

Technical Questionnaire

Target Audience: Technical reviewers

Focus Areas:

Code quality

Security practices

Performance

Maintainability

Question Types: Technical ratings and open-ended responses

3.3 User Observation Records

Target Audience: Students

Purpose: Identify usability issues that may not be verbally reported

Method: Structured observation template tracking task completion time, errors, and confusion points

3.4 Paired Coding Review Template

Target Audience: Programming professional

Purpose: Conduct a structured technical review of the codebase

Coverage:

Code readability

Security implementation

Efficiency

Best practice compliance

Each material is specifically designed to collect focused, high-quality feedback relevant to its audience.

4. Feedback Gathering Methodology

The feedback process will be carried out over one week and divided into clear phases to ensure organisation and consistency.

Phase 1: Preparation and Distribution (Days 1–2)

Actions:

Finalise screencasts, questionnaires, and templates

Create Google Forms for questionnaires

Brief participants on the purpose of the feedback

Distribute screencasts:

Non-technical screencast sent to students, parents, and tutors

Technical screencast sent to technical reviewers

Phase 2: Feedback Collection (Days 3–5)

Actions:

Participants complete questionnaires independently

Conduct supervised observation sessions with students

Carry out paired code review session with programming professional

Take structured notes during observations and reviews

Phase 3: Collation and Initial Analysis (Days 6–7)

Actions:

Export questionnaire results to spreadsheets

Organise qualitative feedback by theme

Identify recurring issues and strengths

Prepare feedback summaries for Task 3A evaluation

5. Specific Tasks for Observation Sessions

During observation sessions, students will be asked to complete realistic tasks independently.

Task 1: Account Registration and Login

Instruction:
“Please create a student account and log into the system.”

Rationale:
Tests onboarding, validation, and navigation.

Observations:

Time taken

Errors made

Understanding of validation messages

Task 2: Assignment Submission

Instruction:
“Submit an assignment for one of your courses.”

Rationale:
Tests a core functional requirement.

Observations:

Ease of file upload

User confidence after submission

Task 3: Viewing Progress and XP

Instruction:
“Check your progress and XP for your course.”

Rationale:
Tests dashboard clarity and engagement features.

Observations:

Ability to locate progress

Understanding of XP system

6. Data Collection and Recording Strategy
Questionnaire Data

Collected using Google Forms

Exported to Excel

Quantitative results averaged

Qualitative responses grouped by theme

Observation Notes

Recorded using structured templates

Timings measured

Direct quotes noted

Typed up immediately after sessions

Code Review Feedback

Completed using review template

Additional notes taken during discussion

Stored as: Code_Review_[Reviewer]_[Date].docx

All data will be anonymised and stored securely to comply with ethical and GDPR requirements.

7. Conclusion

This feedback plan provides a structured, systematic approach to gathering high-quality feedback on the GibJohn Tutoring prototype. By involving both technical and non-technical stakeholders and using multiple feedback methods, the plan ensures comprehensive evaluation of usability, functionality, and technical implementation.

The collected feedback will be analysed to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement, directly informing refinements documented in Task 3A and recommendations presented in Task 3B.
